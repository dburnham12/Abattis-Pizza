                            Hi, I'm Angela Anaconda, and I just had the cheesiest, yummiest, most crust-tastic pizza
                            ever at Abattis Pizza in Kingston.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The pepperoni was stacked like a meat mountain, and the cheese stretched longer than Johnny
                            Abatti's excuses. The crust? Crispy on the outside, soft on the inside — like a pizza
                            pillow. Gina Lash got veggie (of course), and even that was good. Nanette tried to act fancy
                            with her truffle pizza, but I saw her smile. Busted.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The staff were super nice, the garlic dip was life-changing, and Gordy only sneezed once. A
                            total win.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            So if you're in Kingston and hungry, get to Abattis. It's officially Angela
                            Anaconda-approved!

                                As a self-declared food expert, let me say — Abattis Pizza in Kingston is divine. The
                                crust is perfectly crisp, the sauce is rich and tangy, and the cheese? Melted
                                perfection. I had the veggie supreme and nearly cried. It was that good.
                            </p>
                            <p>Even the garlic knots deserve a gold medal.</p>

                                Hi… I'm Johnny Abatti. And I just wanna say… Abattis Pizza in Kingston is, like… whoa.
                                So good. I ate three slices and then one more just to be sure. Yep — still awesome.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The crust was all crispy and chewy, like a pizza cloud. The pepperoni had the perfect
                                zing, and the cheese… it stretched. Like, really stretched. I showed Angela and she
                                said, "Eat it, don't wear it," but I was demonstrating.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Also, they had this garlic dip that made me do the happy dance (Angela says I do it
                                every time I eat, but this time it was extra).
                            </p>
                            <p>Anyway, 10 out of 10. I'd eat it again… like, right now. Or now. Or maybe now?</p>

                                Hi. It's Gordy. I usually avoid pizza places because… you know… germs. But Angela
                                insisted, and I brought my hand sanitizer (three kinds, just in case).
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                To my surprise… Abattis Pizza was shockingly clean. The counters sparkled. The server
                                wore gloves. I almost cried.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                And the pizza? I ordered plain cheese — safest option — and it was delicious. The crust
                                wasn't even touched by human hands (thank goodness), and the cheese melted in a very
                                controlled way.
                            </p>
                            <p>No allergic reactions. No sneezing fits. Just a very nice, very safe meal.</p>
